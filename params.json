Up to 320 characters, Google Voice automatically splits messages into 160-character chunks and sends them, but if you go beyond that amount, the rest is discarded.\r\n\r\nThis app seeks to solve that by splitting a submitted message into 160-character chunks before it reaches Google's servers, thus avoiding the character limits Google enforces. In other words, if you need to send a long text message, it will probably be cut off if you send it directly through Google Voice, but this app will divide your message into chunks and send them individually.\r\n\r\n### Technical details\r\n\r\nI wrote this code very quickly, so there is little documentation. But the project's functionality is fairly simple, so hopefully it is self-explanatory. A standard ASP.NET MVC infrastructure is used, and respones are cached and gzip-ed.\r\n\r\n**Platform**:\r\n * .NET 4\r\n * ASP.NET MVC 3\r\n * [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)\r\n * [SharpGoogleVoice](http://bitbucket.org/jitbit/sharpgooglevoice)\r\n * jQuery\r\n * [RiaLibrary.Web](http://maproutes.codeplex.com/)\r\n\r\nSee the `LICENSE` file for license information.","name":"Long SMS with Google Voice","tagline":"A simple website where Google Voice users can send long messages in small chunks.","google":"UA-16705395-2"}
